the world have come and invaded us, captured our lands, conquered our minds.
From Alexander onwards, the Greeks, the Turks, the Mughals, the Portuguese, the British,
the French, the Dutch, all of them came and looted us, took over what was ours.
Yet we have not done this to any other nation. We have not conquered anyone.
We have not grabbed their land, their culture,
their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them."""
